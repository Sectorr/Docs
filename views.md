<h1>Views</h1>
<p>Views are were you output your HTML and application logic come together. In views you can use the variable data from a <a href="http://www.sectorr.co/docs/controllers" >Controller</a> and use this in your HTML. The Views are located in the <code class="language-php">app/Views</code> directory</p>

<h2>Basic views</h2>
<p>Sectorr uses blade templating, this means every view has to have a <code class="language-php">.blade.php</code> extension. So a view name would be for example: <code class="language-php">welcome.blade.php</code>.</p>

<p>A basic view would look something like this.</p>
BASIC VIEW
<p>This file would be located at: <code class="language-php">app/Views/welcome.blade.php</code></p>
